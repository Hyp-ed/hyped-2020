This is the official repository of HYPED. HYPED is a student society at the University of Edinburgh dedicated to accelerating the development of Hyperloop and implementing the technology in the UK. HYPED is advancing both technical and commercial development of Hyperloop, having seen success in two international competitions. https://hyp-ed.com/

## Coding Style

Since we will have dozens of developers coding for the pod, it is very important that everyone adheres to the same code style. For that purpose we have created the following [style guide](https://hyp-ed.github.io/styleguide/).

## Building and Running Unit Tests
To build and run the unit test suite use `make testrunner`. An executable will be generated at `test/testrunner`. 

To include more tests, add them under `test/src` and add the file path to `test/Test.files`
